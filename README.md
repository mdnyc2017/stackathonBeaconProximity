# Stackathon Project: Bluetooth Beacon Proximity Application
## By Michael Douglas

This application coded in Swift listens for the transmissions of three Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons by [Estimote](https://estimote.com/products/).

The color of the Beacon with the strongest signal, i.e. the closest beacon, is reflected on the iPhone's screen.

This application is a basic demonstration of the potential for Bluetooth Beacons and proximity triggered events.
